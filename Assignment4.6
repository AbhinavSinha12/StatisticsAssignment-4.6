Assignment 4.6

Two balls are drawn at random in succession without replacement from an urn
containing 4 red balls and 6 black balls.
Find the probabilities of all the possible outcomes.

First we to determine the probabilities of the events.

  events           Probability
    RR          (4/10)(3/9) = 2/15
    RB          (4/10)(6/9) = 4/15
    BR          (6/10)(4/9) = 4/15 
    BB          (6/10)(5/9) = 1/3

The probability of 0 blue balls (RR)is 2/15
The probability of 1 blue ball is (RB or BR) is 4/15+4/15 = 8/15
The probability of 2 blue balls (BB) is 1/3

So the probability distribution is:

Z   p(Z)
--------   
0   2/15
1   8/15
2   1/3

Notice that the sum of the probabilities = 2/15+8/15+1/3 = 1
